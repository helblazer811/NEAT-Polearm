- TODO
- clustering
	- Fix the distance metric
	x Maybe employ clustering on the genome difference data
	- Figure out a way to have cluster continuity across generations
		(ie what clusters are the same from one generation to the next)
- Implement crossover
- Make a better selection rule
- Integrate random mutation
- Allow parameterization for mutation, crossover, species difference 
    thresholds, at the top level in run_neuroevolution
- Make a progress bar
